                <p>
                    Home stagers are an important of the selling process in San Francisco. Buyers expect to see a well-designed, modern-looking home. In the Bay Area, you can't avoid staging a property. Check out most open houses, and you'll notice a sleek, clean, and modern presentation. Abstract art hangs on the wall. Kitchen countertops are clean, and a fresh fruit bowl is present. The plumbing fixtures are clean and shiny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You see nice curtains and minimal, modern furniture in the living room. How is that happening? Is everyone hiring a home staging service in San Francisco?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me tell you that most people in San Francisco go with a home staging service. Bay Area homes are expensive, and acc<a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2021-profile-of-home-staging-report-04-06-2021.pdf">ording to 23% of</a> seller's agents in <a href="https://www.haleysellsthecity.com/blog/how-to-stage-your-san-francisco-home-for-a-successful-open-house/#_msocom_1">the N</a>AR's 2021 report, buyer's dollar offers increased by 1% to 5% in comparison to similar homes. This means that you could be losing up to 5% of your home value, which could easily be $50,000.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Staged homes sell faster and for more money. I understand that you don't always want to spend money on a home staging service, which is okay. We can still do a couple things to make the home look great. We can use some of the services offered by staging companies, which include paying the stager when the house sells. Let's see how you can stage a home without breaking the bank in San Francisco.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to NAR, <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/profile-of-home-staging">most buyers (82%)</a> find it easy to visualize themselves in a staged house. A vacant home won't make the cut, and you don't want to imagine living in a cluttered house.

            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Options for Staging</h3>
                <p>
                    Before we start, we need to know which staging options are popular with buyers. I can guide you through these options. If you like to be hands-on, it is possible to hire a professional home designer for a consultation. The consultation fee will be charged at an hourly rate, and you can understand which areas of your home need improvements. You will understand everything about the color theory, furniture placement, and design. With customized information, you can think of the next steps.
                </p>
                <h3>Furniture Rental</h3>
                <p>
                    Every room in the house serves a specific purpose. The bedroom should have a closet, a bed, a side table, and perhaps a lamp. You don't expect to see food items in a bedroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Move around your furniture so that every room has a designated purpose. If you're selling a vacant house, you will need to use a furniture rental service. It's not a good idea to invest in expensive home decor pieces, as you can always rent them or find more affordable options at a <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/thrift-stores-san-francisco-17915072.php">thrift store</a>. The idea is to present your home as a blank canvas, but fill in the basic details for the buyer.
                </p>
                <h3>De-personalize the Area</h3>
                <p>
                    Just removing family photos is not depersonalization. It's difficult to depersonalize after you have spent a few years in the house, and everything is customized to your taste. Work alongside your realtor and see where you can improve in this area. It is a common idea to redo your workspace, home gym, study area, and kitchen.
                </p>
                <h3>Declutter the House</h3>
                <p>
                    That's probably the most challenging step. We all accumulate things over time, and it's difficult to get rid of them. If you cannot     eliminate things, you will need to look into a storage service where you can store your luggage until the house sells. You can look into your options and see how much space you will need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another idea is to ask friends & family members to take care of your belongings for at least 2 months.
                </p>

                <h3>Improve the Lightning</h3>
                <p>
                    Dark homes don't sell well. Install powerful lights if your home doesn't get enough natural light. Bright rooms enhance mood, whereas dark areas look gloomy. You want to present a happy home where the new homeowners will build memories just like you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paly with this idea and see if you can install lamps or light fixtures that will improve your home's presentation. If you have old lamps, clean the exterior so the light can shine properly.
                </p>
                <h3>Paint the House</h3>
                <p>
                    Depending on the condition, you might want to paint your home. <a href="https://www.homelight.com/blog/should-i-repaint-my-house-before-selling/">Painting and landscaping provide the biggest ROI</a> among home improvements. You might want to paint not just for staging but for improving your sales proceeds. Go with a neutral palette and paint both the interior and exterior. I will guide you through the most trending paint color options in your neighborhood, whether it is Noe Valley or the Sunset. We can discuss what's popular based on the recent open houses and recently completed home sales in your area.
                </p>
                <h3>Plants and Flowers</h3>
                <p>
                    Natural beauty is welcoming. Especially when the trend is a Japanese mid-century modern where wood elements are combined with green leafy elements of nature. When possible, add fresh flowers. You can also bring artificial plant pots. Artificial plant pots are much better today than 10 years ago, when a person would have to touch the plants to feel the difference.
                </p>
                <h3>What is the best day to hold an open house in San Francisco?</h3>
                <p>
                    The first weekend (preferably Sunday) after listing your home is the best day to hold an open house event in the Bay area. I will help you arrange the timing so we can get the maximum exposure for your property.
